This paper examines the impact of five major gun control laws enacted in Illinois between 2018-2024 on mass shooting patterns in 
Chicago, analyzing their effectiveness across pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Through comprehensive analysis of 
Gun Violence Archive data, we investigate how legislative measures influenced shooting frequency, casualty rates, and incident 
characteristics during this unprecedented period of societal change. Using Interrupted Time Series Analysis, we evaluated both immediate 
and sustained effects of each intervention while controlling for COVID-19 related disruptions. Our findings reveal varying levels of 
effectiveness across different legislative approaches, with administrative measures like FOID Modernization showing superior outcomes 
compared to specific prohibitions. The research demonstrates significant shifts in incident patterns, with traditional weekend/weekday 
ratios and seasonal variations transforming notably during the pandemic period. While overall victim counts decreased following certain 
interventions, we observed concerning displacement effects, including increases in gang-related activities and shifts in incident locations. 
These results suggest that successful gun violence prevention requires a combination of comprehensive administrative frameworks and 
targeted enforcement measures, with careful attention to implementation timing and potential adaptive responses.
